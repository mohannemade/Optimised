# Optimised-Wirless-Sensor-Node-With-Mqtt
The project is designing optimised sensor node in a network communicating wirelessly which is achieved by using a set of devices which leads to low power consumption, low form factor, low current ratings and efficient working of network. The project consists of two sensor node communicating to a base station through RF communication through Enhanced Shockburst Protocol and then further the data is transfered to the gateway(which is a rasberry pi) for further commands to control devices using actuator nodes ,etc.The communication between base station and gateway is estalished using Node Red with mqtt protocol by establishing a broker and client.
